This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## A brief description of this App

Italy has 20 regions, each of them with a particular food palette. The northern regions are famous for wine that pairs with very rich dishes. The central regions are famous for meat and incredible handmade pasta. The southern regions are famous for seafood dishes.

The purpose of Sapori d’Italia is to allow users to experience these authentic recipes and let them contribute and expand to this amazing culinary rainbow. With this app, users can surf through the 20 regions of Italy, and with one click, save the recipes you like to their cookbooks. The recipes are organized by region and can be rated by a five stars system. If you have a recipe to share, it can be added to the ongoing expanding database, and even include a picture. Let other users know about new creations by sending a notification on the message board. We hope that through this app, users will share their passion for the world's best food and help the Italian heritage stay alive.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
